## Description

The purpose of this webpage is to create a daily planner that shows current time based on color and saves appointments in the text boxes. 

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

When the page opens, the user is presented with a series of rows that are differentiated by time stamps. each indicates an hour of the work day. They automatically change color based on the current hour. past hours are grey, the present hour is red, and future hours are green. The user has the ability to save text in each row by entering it into the text box for the rwo and clicking the save icon. The information is saved in local storage and reprinted on page refresh. There is also a clear appointments button that erases local storage so that, on page refresh, the text in the boxes is erased. local time is also indicated in the header and reloads on page refresh.
